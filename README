ACE3 - Advanced Canvas Game Engine 3D

Everything is in development, a work in progress, and actually I can't suggest it
for any use. At this stage the code-refactoring is very frequent, and adopted solutions/theories are changed
in a blink to improve performance or the workflow.

NOTES FOR ACE3 BUGS

NOTES FOR THE DEVELOPER:
- Do not assign position or rotations to some value or vec3 when combined with other
  movements of the object, because this could be not instantly updated by the engine,
  so you end up with unwanted results.
  The SOLUTION is to call updateMatrix() whenever you use those functions.
